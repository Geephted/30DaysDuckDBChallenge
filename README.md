# 30DaysDuckDBChallenge

## Introduction 
I'm absolutely thrilled to embark on this exciting journey of data exploration and analysis with DuckDB in conjunction with MotherDuck. The #30DaysDuckDBChallenge represents a unique opportunity for me to dive headfirst into the world of data, unlocking valuable insights and honing my skills using DuckDB, a robust database management system.

Over the next 30 days, I'll be on an adventure, delving into diverse datasets and refining my abilities in data manipulation, querying, and analysis. With DuckDB, I'm eager to make sense of data and draw meaningful conclusions.

This repository serves as my central hub for all things related to this challenge. Here, I'll share tasks, queries, visuals and insights discovered from the dataset. It's a golden opportunity for me to push my boundaries, experiment with the FIFA2021 datasets, and relish the excitement of uncovering hidden patterns and insights within the datasets.

## Dataset
The dataset for the #30DaysDuckDBChallenge consists of two FIFA 2021 datasets, both provided in CSV format. These datasets are comprehensive and rich, containing detailed information about football players, including their attributes, club affiliations, and performance statistics. They offer an excellent opportunity for me to sharpen my data analysis skills and extract valuable insights while tackling the challenge's tasks. The FIFA 2021 dataset is the perfect companion for this data exploration journey.

## Tools
DuckDB and Power BI are the dynamic duo of the #30DaysDuckDBChallenge. DuckDB, a high-performance analytical database, is our data engine, powering the analysis and insights throughout the challenge. It's where our data comes to life and reveals its stories.

Complementing DuckDB is Power BI, our visualization powerhouse. With its interactive and visually appealing reports and dashboards, Power BI transforms data into meaningful insights, making them accessible and actionable. Together, DuckDB and Power BI are our tools of choice for this exciting data exploration journey.

## Day 1
To kickstart my #30DaysDuckDBChallenge journey, i started by creating a Motherduck account and becoming part of the Motherduck community. Next, I install DuckDB and set it up on my local machine. I also make sure to install Power BI on my computer and configure it to be ready for action. As I make progress, I share my updates on Twitter and LinkedIn, posting a screenshot of my Motherduck account. This is where the adventure begins

## Day 2
The next step is to create a DuckDB database named "challenge." I loaded the two FIFA dataset files into DuckDB. With my data securely loaded into DuckDB, I connected my DuckDB with Motherduck, our collaborative platform. This connection will make it easier for a third party with the shared link to explore the data efficiently. Then, I shared my progress, as it is encouraged, enhancing the collaborative and enriching learning experience.
